# HTML Template Generator

## Overview

A CLI solution for generating HTML templates with important meta tags for SEO.

## Description

This project was created with the intent to make it easier to start a front-end web development project with SEO in mind. Before beginning a project, users can run through the questions in the command line to generate an HTML file that includes important features for optimization.

Creating this project was a great way for me to improve in my ability to understand and utilize promises in JavaScript. I also used modularization so that the script files could be separated based on function and easier to read. I have personally used this template generator a few times as I've begun new projects and found it helpful.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript
- Node
- Inquirer

## Installation

To use this HTML template generator, clone the source code to your local computer in a desired folder and run the command ```node index.js``` to start the application.

## Usage

This application is meant to make the web development process a bit smoother, but it is not an exhaustive SEO solution. Continue to utilize best practices in terms of SEO.
